# ICCM Europe 2024

## Day 1: Use

### Part one

Something to think about…

> Yesterday, how many times do you think you unlocked your phone?

#### Romans 12:2

> Do not be conformed to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is – his good, pleasing and perfect will.

#### 2 John 1:12

> I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete

#### Jeremiah 2:5
> This is what the Lord says:
> "What fault did your ancestors find in me, that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves…"

#### Genesis 1:27
> So God created mankind in his own image,
> in the image of God he created them;
> male and female he created them.


#### Discussion questions:

- What tech do you use… but barely think about it as technology?
- Are there specific bits of technology or apps that take up too much time in your life?
- What impact do you see that having on your relationship with God, and the people around you?

### Part two

#### A redemptive arc

- Gen 2
- Gen 6
- Exodus 31
- Mark 6
- Luke 23

#### Micah 4:3

> He shall judge between many peoples,
> and shall decide disputes for strong nations far away;
> and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
> and their spears into pruning hooks;
> nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
> neither shall they learn war anymore…

#### Discussion questions:
- Read Galatians 5:22 - Fruit of the Spirit
- Now pick a piece of technology that you use everyday and think about the ways in which it might shape and change you.
- How does that area of technology help / hinder you in living out the Fruit of the Spirit or more broadly your walk with Christ?
