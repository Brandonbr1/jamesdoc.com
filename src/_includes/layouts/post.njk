    It's possibly been exported and imported from at least
    three different blogging platforms over the years. That probably means, at
    best, there are broken images and links. If the post is technical in nature,
    any advice is probably out of date and irrelevant. Or it is <em>really</em> old, it was
    the wafflings of a teenager with too much time on his hands working out what
    blogging is… If it is the latter I would probably cringe if I re-read it.
    But it's here because it's part of my past, not my present.

  <p>{{ date | readableDate }} was a long time ago, and as such I'd encourage you to tread carefully through this post. Links maybe dead, recommendations given may no longer be seen as good best practice, and technical implementation may at best be dated, if not entirely outdated. You've been warned!</p>
