<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/olitaylor">Oli Taylor</a> and I have been working on a bit of test footage for our Digital Special Effects course and Lincoln Uni. &nbsp;The final idea will involve shooting people against a green screen and placing them on top of the cards, rather than the cool stick men. &nbsp;This is the basic idea, working out how to motion track and mask correctly in Adobe's After Effects. &nbsp;There is a lot of work still to go, but I'm loving it so far!</p>
