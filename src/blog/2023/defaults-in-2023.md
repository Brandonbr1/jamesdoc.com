There's been a [trend floating](https://defaults.rknight.me/network/) [around](https://rknight.me/app-defaults/) [the](https://birchtree.me/blog/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023/) [blogosphere](https://jasonfry.co.uk/blog/app-defaults/) [this](https://calebhearth.com/apps-i-use-2023) [month](https://www.josemunozmatos.com/blog/my-app-defaults-2023-edition) looking at the default apps people are using… I like that. This is my list:

## 📨 Mail Client

I've got far too many email addresses… and I'm checking each of them via webmail on the desktop. Mostly Google Workspace / Gmail. I don't like this solution. I really should get back into a proper mail client in 2024!

## 📮 Mail Server

For my personal account it's Google Workspace behind the scenes. I want set and forget. This does that for me.

## 📝 Notes

I had a time with Notion over the last few years, however I've mostly reverted back to markdown files for serious notes, or a one-liner in a WhatsApp chat with myself!

## ✅ To-Do

At work… Asana. Out of work it's the wild-west of what I remember next!

## 📆 Calendar

[Cron](https://cron.com/) has been a game changer this year.

## 📁 Cloud File Storage

I've been with [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/AAA8vbnFzkbKTPBYLY1v69OIzqR_vwcc1H8?src=global9) for forever. I don't see that changing any time soon.

## 📖 RSS

[Reeder](https://reederapp.com/) has been in my life for a long time. I recently cleared out all the subscriptions and started again with it.

## 🌐 Browser

This year I've been experimenting with [Arc](https://arc.net/). I can't get it to stick for web dev work (which I'm still using Chrome for), but for every-day browsing, Arc is working well for me.

## 💬 Chat

I switching into [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/) half way through the year… having WhatsApp, SMS, Signal, and Telegram all in one makes me very happy.

## 📑 Read It Later

On a good day [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) is the tool for the job. My experience with this is that I go in waves with it– I add a lot of things into it, and then forget to go and read the articles, and then looking at the list is overwhelming… So I forget about it and come back to it, wipe it, start again, and then have the same issue all over again.

## 📜 Word Processing

Google Docs and [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer).

## 📈 Spreadsheets

Rarely. Almost never.

## 📊 Presentations

Keynote. It's solid and reliable. I experimented with [Presenter from iA](https://ia.net/presenter) last year. I loved it, but I put presentations together so infrequently that I couldn't justify the sticker price.

## 🎵 Music

Spotify. Not sure if I should feel bad about this one at the moment.

## 🦣 Mastodon

[Elk](https://elk.zone/) as a PWA, across all devices.

## 🎤 Podcasts

[Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/) has been solid for years. It also has a simple Amazon Alexa skill which works well.

## 🔐 Password Management

I've been running off KeePass for years, running [MacPass](https://macpassapp.org/) on MacOS, and [Keepass2Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android&hl=en_GB&gl=US) on my phone.
