date: 2023-05-29
intro: View transitions are one of the latest and greatest things to be working their way through the web specifications; and they are pleasingly simple to implement.

At the moment view transitions are still being implemented, but it doesn't mean that you can't get ahead of the curve and experiment with them. However they're not enabled by default; so in Chrome Canary you'll need to toggle the following settings first:

```
chrome://flags#view-transition
chrome://flags#view-transition-on-navigation
```

## Cross fade

The default behaviour for view transitions is a simple cross fade between two pages and to get that working all you need to do is add this `meta` tag to the `<head>` of your page:

```
<meta name="view-transition" content="same-origin">
```

Deploy that, and you're done. This will give you a cross fade between every page. Nice and neat.

## Going further

There's a lot more power in view transitions, but that will take you more than two minutes to implement. However, not by much; 28 lines of CSS, and 3 tweaks to the HTML later and there is a nice tween between the blog listing page and the blog post itself. You can see [the related commit on Github](https://github.com/jamesdoc/jamesdoc.com/commit/4d825f7823717672b0a14410af6c5a4aa771ffad).
