One of the people I follow on Twitter, [@benhollebon](https://www.twitter.com/benhollebon) posted a link to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0oHlX8Kmxk) earlier with the simple title 'Thought Provoking'.  It's not a short YouTube clip, but it does match the title.  It's a really simple video asking some really big questions about life, one of my favourite 'What motivates you - love or fear?'

I'm still thinking about how I would answer all of them, perhaps I'll run a blog series on them after my dissertation has been handed in.  In the mean time have a think yourself... what motivates you in life? Love or Fear?
