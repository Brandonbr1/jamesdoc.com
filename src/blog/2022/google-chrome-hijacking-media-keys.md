Chrome likes to steal your media keys - the play/pause buttons on your keyboard and then map them through to YouTube, or similar media. This is regardless of if Chrome has focus, or if the tab has focus - you can have a paused YouTube window in the background, want to pause your music via Spotify, hit the pause button on your keyboardâ€¦ and suddenly you have Spotify still playing, and the YouTube video.

Nightmare.

To stop that from happening Chrome has a setting that you can toggle to disable this:

> chrome://flags/#hardware-media-key-handling

Copy that URL into the address bar, switch the setting from _default_, to _disabled_, and then reopen Chrome.
