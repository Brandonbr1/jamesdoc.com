It is a fairly harmless question... do you know what a browser is?  Google put this question to 50 people in Times Square, New York, and I'll be honest I was surprised at the answers that were given.

Ok, so perhaps the research was a little off because the guy was from Google, however the results are still fairly shocking so I thought I would use a nice little video that I found to advertise Google Chrome that nicely explains what a browser is:

All sorted? Good! Yes, your browser is a cat, that fetches the little bird that are web pages.
