Today we prepared for Lent in the IFES office by eating lots of pancakes for lunch, it was tasty!

You may remember this time last year I took part in reLENTless, a set of six challenges over the lent period to explore more about the idea of sacrifice. This year I&#39;m doing it again.

World Vision Acts and IFES are exploring John 10:10:

> "... I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full."

What does Jesus mean when he says life and to the full? And how does that practically look like in my life?
