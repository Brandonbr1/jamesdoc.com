_In light of Covid-19 and lots of churches moving their services online I had a chat with [CCLI](https://uk.ccli.com/) and [PRS for music](https://www.prsformusic.com/) around the legalities of live streaming the sung worship in your church. What follows is my understanding of the situation…_.

The short summary of my call - **If you are using streaming services like YouTube or Facebook live you're fine because they have paid the license for _user generated_ content.** This means that your church's band, organist, solo pianist, etc is treated like a covers band on these platforms. Playing 'covers' of the latest worship songs is permitted.

What you can't do is use commercially recorded music and sing over the top of it - don't livestream your church karaoke - that recording is copyrighted.

If you are using something other than Facebook or YouTube I would encourage you to double check the service provider's policy for such things. I know of a number of churches that are using services like Skype and Zoom, I doubt that they have that kind of license in place.

If (for some reason) a technically competent member of your church built from scratch their own live streaming platform… PRS for Music has the [Limited Online Music Licence](https://www.prsformusic.com/licences/using-music-online/limited-online-music-licence), band A costs ~£150 year and should cover you, however [have a chat with PRS first](https://www.prsformusic.com/help/contact-us).

**For all other questions related to the church and Coronavirus there is [a growing Google Doc](http://covid.churcheshandbook.co.uk/) that is being put together by a number of excellent and trusted friends: [covid.churcheshandbook.co.uk](http://covid.churcheshandbook.co.uk/).**

\*Nb: Strong disclaimer here: I'm not a lawyer, I'm just someone who had a couple of phone calls over lunch. I'll update this post if my understanding of the situation changes.
